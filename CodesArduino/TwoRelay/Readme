This code is updated on July 18, 2017 and tested on one 2DM542 and one TB6560 driver.

It has following features:
1. One relay is used to connect SMPS to loads (LASER and motors). This relay is driven by Arduino board. 
	digitalWrite(13, LOW); 

2. Second relay is turned on automatically when SMPS is found to be ON.
	if(analogRead(smps)>=300)

3. Second relay is driven by the output of step down module (4v). Earlier it was driven by Arduino board. 
4. "Start Calibrate" does not switch ON second relay.
